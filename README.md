# CarND_P3-Behavioral-Cloning
Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project 3

# Project Objective
Build and train a neural network to learn to steer a car on the Udacity Simulator.

# Instructions
- Gather data from the Udacity Simlutor
- Use Keras to build and train the network
- Validate the model by running the Udacity Simulator in autonomous mode. 

# Gather data


# Building the network


# Training the network

Save your trained model architecture as model.h5 using model.save('model.h5').

# Validating the model
Open the Udacity Simluator in autonomous mode. The car will just sit there until your Python server connects to it and provides it steering angles. Start the Python server as follows:

python drive.py model.h5
